## 🎯 Purpose
This repository is my **2026 consistency challenge** to master:
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Java fundamentals through problem solving
- Better coding logic for **SDET / Automation Testing**
- Strong foundation for future **Java Developer** role

---

## 📌 What this repo contains
✅ Day-wise folders with:
- Java code solutions  
- Output / result screenshots or output text  

---

## 🧠 Rules I Follow (Discipline Mode)
- ✅ Practice daily (no zero day)
- ✅ Upload code in day-wise folders only
- ✅ Keep solutions clean & readable
- ✅ Focus on solving first, optimizing later

---

## 🚀 Why I’m doing this
Because I want:
- Better logic building
- Faster debugging
- Clean code habits
- Strong interview preparation
- Confidence in coding

**Consistency > Motivation**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- Java
- DSA concepts (arrays, strings, recursion, sorting, searching, stacks, queues, linked list, trees, graphs etc.)

---

## ✅ Start Date
📅 18 January 2026

---

## 🏁 End Goal
By end of 2026:
- Strong DSA foundation
